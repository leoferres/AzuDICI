These are the sources of the (pedagogical) parallel SAT solver
AzuDICI. To compile, just run 'make'. This will build 'ad', the
parallel solver. This solver has been inspired, quite heavily, by both
the Barcelogic SAT solver and Lingeling (http://fmv.jku.at/lingeling/)
by Armin Biere.

The file 'src/version.h' contains the current version of the system.
